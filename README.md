This project is a multi-page frontend React template.

## Multi-Page Entry Points
* Create a new HTML file in the `public` directory (it can have multiple levels, e.g., `public/test/home.html`).
* Create a corresponding folder in the `src/pages` directory with the same structure as in the `public` directory (e.g., `src/test/home`), then create an `index.js` file inside it as the entry JavaScript file for the page.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

本项目为支持多页面的前端React模版项目

## 多页面入口
* public 目录下新建html文件（可以有多级路径，eg: public/test/home.html）
* src/pages 目录下新建与 public 目录下相同文件夹（eg: src/test/home），然后在该新建路径中创建index.js即为页面的入口js
